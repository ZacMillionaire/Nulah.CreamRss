# TODO
- disable the add feed view while feed details are fetched
- display error feedback if a feed fails to save
- remove obsolete image properties from entity model
- implement batch feed adding
  - probably have a loading spinner for each feed in turn
- ~~create rss icon index to avoid needless fetching for similar icons~~
  - nevermind, I want to add the ability for someone to assign a custom image for feed icons if they wish
